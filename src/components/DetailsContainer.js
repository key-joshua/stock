                        As a small business owner, you have a lot of things to juggle. Profitability and cash flow are always at the forefront of your mind. Plus you need to handle the day-to-day operations of your business. You need to make it hum while you send quotations, take orders and then ship them out. You run a lean business model with minimal overheads and using web-based inventory management software plays a big part in this.
